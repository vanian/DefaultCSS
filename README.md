# DefaultStyleCSS
Default CSS styling framework
Instead of defining the same styling/positioning/effects for every new project, I have created a framework for resuse. 
Added additional classes that I use frequently

Framework for small projects, where developers need not spend time in wrting what might be the most ovbious. 
I hope this helps you. 

Let me know if you have any suggestions. 

V.1
- basic generalized styling for most html5 elements as well as some classes for effects
- Still in starting stages. More updates very soon
